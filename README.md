#### Most used Linux distros currently in IT industry. 

  RPM based:- RHEL & Centos 
  Debian based :- Ubuntu Server


#### Diffrence between RPM based and Debian based.

  From user’s point of view, there isn’t much difference in these tools. The RPM and DEB formats are both just archive files, with some metadata 
  attached to them. They are both equally arcane, have hardcoded install paths and only differ in subtle details. 
  DEB files are installation files for Debian based distributions. 
  
  RPM files are installation files for Red Hat based distributions. Ubuntu is based on Debian’s package manage based on APT and DPKG. Red Hat, 
  CentOS and Fedora are based on the old Red Hat Linux package management system, RPM.



#### DEB or .deb (Debian based softwares) 
  
  DEB is the extension of the Debian software package format and the most often used name for such 
  binary packages. DEB was developed by Bedian. 
  Example: Google chrome software 
  Package name: google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb 
  Installation: dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb 
  
  
  RPM or .rpm (Red Hat based softwares.) 
  It is a package management system. The name RPM variously refers to the .rpm file format, files in 
  this format, software packaged in such files, and the package manager itself. RPM was intended 
  primarily for Linux distributions; the file format is the baseline package format of the Linux 
  Standard Base. RPM was developed by Community & Red Hat. 
  Example: Google chrome software 
  Package Name: google-chrome-stable-57.0.2987.133-1.x86_64.rpm 
  Installation: rpm -ivh google-chrome-stable-57.0.2987.133-1.x86_64.rpm 

  NOTE: You will also encounter diffrent commands, packages and service names while using 
  both kinds of distros
